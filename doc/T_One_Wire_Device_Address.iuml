class T_One_Wire_Device_Address  <<Array_Data_Type>>
{
  Allows to model a data representing the address of a OneWire bus slave device.
  The first byte is the 1-Wire device family code.
  The next 6 bytes (48 bits) are a unique serial number.
  The last byte is a CRC (=X^8+X^5+X^4+1) calculated from the first 56 bits.
